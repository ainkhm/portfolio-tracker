# README

## Project Overview

This is a portfolio tracking web application built using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to:

- **Add Companies**: Enter company name and industry.
- **Add Investments**: Link investments to companies with details like amount invested, valuation, date, and round type.
- **View Investments**: Display investments in a paginated list with styling.
- **Portfolio Summary**: See total invested amount, current value, and ROI.

The code is not perfect, but within 3 hours, I aimed to implement as much as possible while adhering to design patterns and SOLID principles.

## Notes

- **Tailwind CSS** was utilized for rapid styling.
- The **Pagination** component is isolated for reusability.
- **React Context** is used for state management across the app.

## Questions for Improvement

1. **Error Handling**: Should we implement user notifications for success and error states?
2. **Form Validation**: Is there a need for more robust validation on user inputs?
3. **Internationalization**: Do we plan to support multiple languages?
4. **Authentication**: Is user authentication required?
5. **State Management**: Would integrating Redux or another state management library be beneficial?
6. **Performance**: Are there performance optimizations we should consider, like memoization?
7. **Accessibility**: Should we enhance accessibility features for a wider range of users?
8. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Are there specific design improvements desired?
9. **Testing**: Do we need to add unit and integration tests?
10. **Documentation**: Is more detailed code documentation necessary for future development?

I hope this README provides a clear summary and highlights areas for potential improvement.
